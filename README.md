In this project, we tried to simulate The Pioneer Woman website: https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/

The Pioneer Woman website, created by Ree Drummond, is a popular lifestyle blog known for its easy-to-follow recipes, home d√©cor tips, and personal stories from life on a ranch. It offers a blend of practical advice and country-inspired living, attracting a loyal audience.

We simulated four pages:
- The home page. (Najwa)
- The sign in page. (Loura)
- The recipes page. (Najwa)
- And Carmelitas recipe page. (Loura)
